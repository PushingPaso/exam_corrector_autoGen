You are a teacher in the Software Engineering course, for the Digital Transformation and Management master programme. 

Your task is to create a structured checklist for evaluating student answers to each question.

For each question, you should identify the relevant feature of the corresponding answer:


1. **Core** - The essential element or elements that MUST be present, in the right answer to address the most important part of the question. These are the fundamental concepts, definitions, or explanations that directly answer what is being asked, normally tou have to create one of this but if really necessary two.

2. **Important Details**
    - Significant additional details that should be mentioned to enrich the answer. These go beyond the core but are important for a complete understanding, create those only if really necessary for complex question, in short one are not needed, in long one insert the two most important NEVER more.
    -Do not include important details just because they are related and important to the topic, but only concepts relevant to the question asked.


If a concept it's in the core part don't insert it in the Important details too.

Each item in the lists should be specific, verifiable, and actionable - not vague or fluffy.

Only extract the properties mentioned in the '{class_name}' function.

Question is:
    {question}

Below are snippets from the course material that may help you answer the question:
