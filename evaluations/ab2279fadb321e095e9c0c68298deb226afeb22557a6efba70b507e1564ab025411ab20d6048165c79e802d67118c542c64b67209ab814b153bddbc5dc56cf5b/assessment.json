All errors are caught at compile-time before the execution. Compile Once, Run Many.      What is interpreted programming languages, it means by using an interpreter like Python & JavaScript, which code is translated and executed line-by-line at runtime. Usually it runs slower, as it translates while running. All errors will be found during execution, one line at a time. Interpret As You Go.

The process helps developers and stakeholders understand and design the system before implementation.      Common models include:      Structural models like class diagrams to show system components.      Behavioral models like use case and sequence diagrams to show how the system behaves.      Architectural models that outline how components interact in the overall system.      The most commonly used language for modelling is UML (Unifies Modelling Language). Modelling improves communication, aids planning, and reduces errors by allowing early analysis and design before any code is written."

In distributed systems, a broker exploits a queue to manage and optimize communication between distributed components. The broker acts as an intermediary that 1.Enables asynchronous communication, allowing producers and consumers to operate independently. 2. Decouples services, improving flexibility and modularity. 3.Implements load balancing by distributing messages across multiple consumers. 4.Ensures message reliability by storing messages persistently until processed. 5. Supports routing and filtering, directing messages to appropriate consumers.      By leveraging queues in this way, brokers improve scalability, reliability, and maintainability of distributed systems."

      "student_response": "Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages (e.g., private, protected, public in Java pr C++). Instead, it relies on naming conventions and name mangling to indicate the intended visibility of attributes.      In Python, class attributes can be marked as private by prefixing their names with double underscores(__), which triggers name mangling. For example:      class MyClass:          def __init__(self):              self.__hidden = 60      This prevents direct access from outside the class (obj.__hidden raises an error), although the attribute can still be accessed using its mangled name (obj._MyClass__hidden).      This method does not enforce strict privacy but discourages external access and is in python's way that marking attributes as private."

Even fixing a bug can introduce new ones elsewhere (side effects.) 3. Complex dependencies between modules can cause ripple effects.      Regressions can affect functionality, performance, or the user interface. How to detect Regression? Continuous Integration (CI) tools like GitHub Actions can automatically run tests on every code change to ensure that existing features still behave as expected after changes."
