Programming languages are designed to be readable by humans, not machines, so they must be translated into machine code that the CPU can understand. This translation is platform-dependent, as it varies based on hardware and operating system. There are two main approaches to translation: compilation and interpretation. compiled languages like C or C++ are translated into machine code ahead of time by a compiler, producing an executable file. Interpreted languages like Python or Bash are executed line-by-line by an interpreter. Python, however, uses a mix of both: it compiles source code to bytecode and then interprets it through a virtual machine. Interpreted languages like Python are often preferred for rapid development because they support fast trial-and-error experimentation. in contrast, compiled languages may offer better performance and early error detection, since all code is checked before execution. each approach has its strengths, and the choice often depends on the project's requirements. "

The python code we write is already a model of the real world, yet the source code of a project can easily grow in complexity. When complexity is growing, not everybody can work with that level. It's hard for a single person to keep track of big projects. People deal with complexity with modelling languages such as Unified Modelling Language (UML) that is the de-facto standard to model systems in a way that is more simplified and abstract instead of actually writing code. UML helps visualize, specify, construct, and document software systems, providing a shared understanding of a system's design that not only helps teams collaborate, but also supports newcomers on board. UMLs come in two main diagram forms: structural diagrams to represent the static aspects of the system (e.g., class diagram, component diagram); and behavioral diagrams to represent the dynamic aspects (e.g., sequence diagrams, activity diagrams). Less technical than code and gives the chance to design the software before writing the code. Engineers, generally, design models to achieve cost efficiency, early decision-making and collaboration, and that makes no exception with software."

      "student_response": "A queue is a data structure where messages are stored in a FIFO manner. We don't only care about the message to deliver, but also about the delivery order. We still have the couple consumer-producer. If there was no load balancer or cache infrastructure, when A sends a message to B, if B was not online it would mean he is not ready to receive it, and the message gets lost. these infrastructures in the middle give the certainty that the message gets delivered sooner or later. The broker does not only forward the messages, but also keeps track of the produced messages so that it keeps the same order. It memorizes the messages in the queue until they are delivered. It can forget about the messages after delivery. It allows the interactive components to be timely uncoupled, which means consumer and producer are not forced to stay connected simultaneously to interact, with respect to time coupled which is the contrary. It is also important in the design phase to think about the functionality. For example, in videogames played by teams online, savings are frequent and automated so that next time we get connected we can start from the same point, and while playing every player in the team must be present at the same moment so that they can advance together. In the chess game (played again online), a player makes his move but the other does not have to be connected to keep the game running. He receives a notification and when he is ready he plays his next move, and it keeps on this way. This is also the reason why a single game can last a lot. "

At its core, a GitHub Actions workflow is a configuration defined in a YAML file. Each workflow is triggered by specific events and consists of one or more jobs, which run in parallel unless dependencies are explicitly defined. Jobs, in turn, are composed of sequential steps that execute commands or actions. Steps within the same job can share data through outputs, and similarly jobs can communicate via output values. Workflows can be designed to run across multiple OS and versions (for example, repeating a testing job for several python versions on windows, Linux and macOS). Execution is carried out by runners, which are virtual machines managed by GitHub or optionally self-hosted by users. These runners come with pre-installed environments tailored to their OS. GitHub Actions supports complex workflows for building, testing, releasing and deploying software. "

Previously we have already chosen the path where we want to save the folder moving around with the commands cd and eventually dots to distinguish among current (single dot) and parent directories of the current directory (double dot) to change directories. Then we can work on the source code via Visual Studio Code opening it directly from the shell or opening VSC and opening the new folder there.       Git clone allows to create a local copy of a remote directory, including its entire history. If no destination is provided after the command, Git will create a folder with the same name as the repository in the URL's last segment. Git supports cloning via various protocols like https://, ssh:// and file://, with ssh being the recommended version when available for security reasons. Once the repository is cloned, Git automatically checks out the default branch (often master or main) and attaches the head to this branch. The remote repository is saved as origin by default, and the local branch is set to track the remote branch (e.g., origin/master). Additional branches from the remote are also fetched but not checked out by default. This setup ensures that the local copy is synchronized with the remote repository. "

Public ones are attributes that can be accessed and modified by anybody, but since all the users use it, if there is a modification they must be notified because they must know how to use the new code, otherwise the program may not work for them anymore and they have the rights to complain because the attributes were public. Private attributes, instead, are indicated by a double underscore, and these kinds of functions are intended to be manipulated by developers. As a matter of fact, the functionality of the application should be affected in the aye of the user because they should just use public attributes, so it's up to them the choice of using a private attribute and they have no right to be notified if it gets changed because it's a matter of internal development, so they must be aware of the fact that is risky for them to use it. "

It could appear for instance when we conduct tests only upon bugs in a barely tolerable situation of low testing. Indeed, when a bug or regression is discovered, we should not fix the issue right right away, because a fix without a test could be insufficient and the \"fix\" could break another feature (creating a regression; the evolution would be that we fix a bug and then the program works fine).       To prevent regressions, it is crucial to implement regression testing, that involves rerunning preexistent tests to ensure that previous functionality remains intact, automating tests to catch regressions early in the development process, and using structured debugging approaches to reproduce issues, write failing test cases, and validate fixes. "
